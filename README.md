# Red-Blue-Nim-game-implelementation
programming language used for this task is python(3.7) using google colab.

you can run the code on Jypiter notebook or google colab

1st run the code in the first cell.
I have called the fuction a few times to play the game with different inputs.

the output format-
Starting state: {'red': 5, 'blue': 6}
Computer's move: ('red', 1)
Current state: {'red': 4, 'blue': 6}
Which pile do you want to take a marble from? (red or blue)blue
Current state: {'red': 4, 'blue': 5}
Computer's move: ('red', 1)
Current state: {'red': 3, 'blue': 5}
Which pile do you want to take a marble from? (red or blue)blue
Current state: {'red': 3, 'blue': 4}
Computer's move: ('red', 1)
Current state: {'red': 2, 'blue': 4}
Which pile do you want to take a marble from? (red or blue)blue
Current state: {'red': 2, 'blue': 3}
Computer's move: ('blue', 1)
Current state: {'red': 2, 'blue': 2}
Which pile do you want to take a marble from? (red or blue)red
Current state: {'red': 1, 'blue': 2}
Computer's move: ('red', 1)
Current state: {'red': 0, 'blue': 2}
Human wins with a score of -6


1. when you run the code it displays you the current state here we have 2 piles which containts 5 red marble and 6 blue marble respectively.
Since Computer is the Max player to choose which move it wants to select First here it selected red. now it shows the current state and prompts the human player to make move and so on. 

2. at last since computer was the last player to make the move its displays that The Human won with 2*3= -6 points where 2 blue balls were still remaining and 3 points for each blue ball.
